            On November 1, the Houston Astros beat the LA Dodgers in the World Series. This specific matchup was played
            between these teams to determine the winner of the game. There are a lot of factors that led to the Astros
            winning that game, so it’s helpful to break it down.</p>
          <p>
            Simply put, the Astros beat the Dodgers by scoring more points during the game. At the end of it, the Astros
            had 5 points, and the Dodgers only had 1 point, which means the Astros scored more points than the Dodgers
            in the World Series game. Because they had 4 more points than the Dodgers, the Astros are considered the
            winners. But how exactly did they get those points?
          </p>
          <p>
            To earn points, a team must catch, throw, and hit a baseball accordingly. For a team to perform well, each
            individual player must possess these skills. Therefore, it goes without saying that one of the main reasons
            the Astros won the World Series baseball game is because the players themselves were good at baseball. The
            Dodgers, on the other hand, had different players than the Astros. These Dodgers players did not catch,
            throw, and hit baseballs quite as well as the Astros players did. It is important to note how the Astros
            players could catch, throw, and hit baseballs so well that night.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we all know, handling a baseball in these three ways with such immense skill stems from practicing
            baseball. The Astros did so by catching, throwing, and hitting quite a bit before the big showdown against
            the Dodgers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as I know, practicing baseball requires a ball. And every player gets a bat, but only sometimes. The
            same goes for mitts. Balls, bats, and mitts are required to practice baseball and therefore win the World
            Series. But how exactly are these balls, bats, and mitts used in conjunction with one another? Let’s explore
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, these three types of objects are used by the players of the two teams. One team has bats while
            the other team has the ball and mitts. The players with bats don’t want the balls so they hit them away. The
            players with balls throw them because they want the bat-wielding team to have the balls. Oh, and I forgot
            about the mitts. Both teams have certain players with mitts to protect their hands from the balls, because
            the other team gets points if the ball touches the hand of a player. The two teams do this while running
            around in a diamond. Both teams have 9 turns with the bats and 9 turns with the balls. Sometimes players
            steal to get a leg up. They steal the balls or the bats, whichever their team needs more of. This helps the
            team get more points, which we all know is the entire point of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            To complicate things, there are also hot dogs, people kissing on a giant TV screen, and people that aren’t
            on either team that wear jerseys anyway and yell at the players. During the exciting, action-packed, chaotic
            game on November 1st, the Houston Astros managed to get 5 baseball points. That is how they won the World
            Series.
